# Corporate Data Science Survey Project

A little over 600 workers in the Data field have completed surveys in regards to work/life balance. The data includes questions related to salary, preferred programming language, and how happy they are with their work. It spans across the field and multiple countires.

# Goal

Our goal is to learn and experiment with using multiple different types of visualizations to build a dashboard that shows this information.

# Data 

The data comes from [Kaggle}(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamedibrahim1/data-professional-survey-breakdown) It was already mostly ready for use. We just had to remove a few unneeded columns.

# Choosing the visuals 

## Cards

## Gauges
